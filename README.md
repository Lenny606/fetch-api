# API Practice Task

## Overview

This project is a simple practice task designed to help you understand the basics of working with APIs using JavaScript. It includes a simple HTML page that interacts with the DummyJSON API to fetch and display product data, as well as simulate adding new products.

## Features

1. Fetches and displays data for a single product from the DummyJSON API.
2. Provides a form to simulate adding a new product (note: this doesn't actually add data to the DummyJSON database).
3. Demonstrates basic error handling for API requests.
4. Uses inline CSS for simple styling.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests

## API Endpoints Used

- GET: `https://dummyjson.com/products/1` - Fetches data for a single product
- POST: `https://dummyjson.com/products/add` - Simulates adding a new product

## Learning Objectives

By working with this project, you'll learn:

1. How to make GET requests to an API using the Fetch API.
2. How to handle and display data received from an API.
3. How to make POST requests with form data.
4. Basic error handling in API requests.
5. How to update the DOM with JavaScript to display dynamic content.

## Extending the Project

Here are some ideas to extend this project for further learning:

1. Modify the GET request to fetch multiple products and display them in a list.
2. Add functionality to update or delete products (note: these will be simulated with DummyJSON).
3. Implement more robust error handling and user feedback.
4. Enhance the styling using external CSS or a CSS framework.
5. Add form validation before submitting the new product data.

## Notes

Remember that the DummyJSON API is a mock API. While it responds to requests, it doesn't actually store any data you send to it. It's designed for testing and learning purposes only.
